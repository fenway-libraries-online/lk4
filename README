Lk4 is a simple but powerful link forwarding utility.  It consists of a Perl
module (WWW::Lk4.pm) and a FastCGI script that together respond to HTTP
requests with the appropriate redirection.  Configuration is done using a
simple config files and may be driven by look-up tables (flat text files or
BerkeleyDB files) as well.

To build and install:

    ./configure
    [edit config.mk if needed (and perhaps Makefile)]
    make
    sudo make install

Lk4 requires a number of Perl modules; see DEPENDENCIES for details.

Files are installed under /usr/local/lk4 by default; to change this, either
edit config.mk or specify PREFIX when installing:

    sudo make install PREFIX=/path/to/install/root

Installation occurs in $PREFIX/lk4.
